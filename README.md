# Statistics-Project-for-Data-Science

This project is divided into two components. Itâ€™s an assignment that focuses on providing insights about a Boston housing prices dataset from the U.S. Census Service. It answers the following questions: 

Is there a significant difference in the median value of houses bounded by the Charles River or not? Is there a difference in median values of houses of each proportion of owner-occupied units built before 1940? Can we conclude that there is no relationship between Nitric oxide concentrations and the proportion of non-retail business acres per town? What is the impact of an additional weighted distance to the five Boston employment centers on the median value of owner-occupied homes? 

The first section, Statistics Project for Data Science, focuses on visualizing the dataset to extract valuable insights while the second section, Statistics Analysis Project, reveals statistical insights of the data.
